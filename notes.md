#Some notes

## Approach
Designing in balsamiq mockups using bootstrap symbols library and grid system.

Using [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to have google spreadsheet backend. to decouple CMS from front end. 
Drawing and [refining prototype approach from earlier project with WIP interview](https://github.com/pietrop/interactive-transcription-display-proof-of-concept). 

This allows to decouple content from presentation. And easy interface to curate content for non-developers.

## setting up balsamiq with Bootstrap symbols library

[Balsamiq mockup with bootstrap to components](https://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/tag/bootstrap/).

>The main advantage of pairing a pattern library with Balsamiq Mockups is that it can free you from worrying about look, feel, and behavior when designing yet provide pixel-perfect renditions of the final product components.

from toolbar, import bml library.
`project` -> `import` -> `BML Symbol library`

## Table top

## Bootswatch 

"click a [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) theme, last thing you want is for someone to say "oh, you used bootstrap" as that distracts from the experience.


## Sleek transitions

## Making an Overlay 
[w3c](http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_fullscreen_overlay.asp)

## github + github pages for demo preview

use github and put project containing `index.html` inside a colder called `docs` in root of project you can set github pages to read/render page from there and get a live demo right there and then.

Make sure your [`.gitignore`](/.gitignore) excludes media file. and store video /audio elsewhere, eg dropbox public folder, or amazon s3 bucket. Don't commit media to git. makes the repo heavy, because of how git stores snapshots of files.

## Google drive for slides

## Google spreadsheet custom functions (TC calculator)
inspired by [timecode claulator on google sheet](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/calculating-timecode-in-google-sheets/)

However easier to do with 

`Tools` -> `scirpt editor`

```
/**
* Convert timecodes `hh:mm:ss:ms` to seconds
* where ms are ignored
*/
function timecode_to_seconds(tc) {
  var tc = tc.split(":")
  var h = parseInt(tc[0])*60*60
  var m = parseInt(tc[1])*60
  var s =parseInt(tc[2])
  
  return h+m+s
}
```

in excell sheet

`=timecode_to_seconds(F2)` where in this case `F2` for example will contain a timecode `00:01:30:00` that will then be rendered as 90 (secs)
